#### Introduction

Generates an MD5 hash from a text file.

Using MD5 hashes to identify controlled files and ensure they haven't been edited is a common practice, 
especially in situations where high security is not a critical concern.
MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a
128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It's typically used to verify data integrity.


#### Example

```
C:\Users\jon\source\repos\nooogle\MD5HashFromFile>python3 MD5HashFromFile.py
Enter the path of the file > Sonnet18.txt
MD5 hash of the file
f2f03bff7d227225a9166c61fda597b8
```
